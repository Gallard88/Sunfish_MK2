Lighting
-----------

I have been looking into lighting and trying to determine what my requirements are. I have also begun sketching PCBs trying to look for a suitable design. This design needs a large rectangular hole in the centre to accomodate the webcam, This places restrictions on the design as it takes up a siginificant ammount of space.

So far a rectangle with rounded corners appears to be the best fit. This allows for the most ammount of space short of designing a circular PCB. A circular PCB opens up more surface area but not all of this space is usable. The rectangle minimises the boards size removing a lot of wasted space.

Looking into the design there are a lot of unknowns. The biggest unknowns are power consumption, heat generation and how much lighting is actually required. The finally solution should attempt to be as semetrical as possible. This will allow leds to be removed from the design. This may be necessary to reduce self heating and power consumption. 

It is also unknown whether this design will need a diffuser for the LEDs. This should also be looked into.

Outstanding Issues:
* Note 2: Check how many cables will fit in a cable penetrator.
* Note 4: Investigate diffuser options.
* Note 4: Draft list of leds for project.
