Concept Notes 5.

Cable Penetrators.
-----------

I have received the cable penetrators from Blue Robotics. I can fit only 1 cable through the 6mm penetrator. Luckily there is a new 8mm penetrator available and a 14 hole end plate. I can fit a pair of cables (1x thruster) through this penetrator. If I combine it with the 14 hole plate this should not be an issue.

WebCam Light PCB.
-----------

I have found and selected a 1206 LED from Wurth Electronik. I have performed a visual inspection to ensure that the leds will fit. The next step is to order the PCB's so I can assemble a prototype and begin testing.

I am also contructing a prototype board for another project. This will validate several circuit ideas that are in the ECU PCB. This is a cheaper PCB, meaning that if I have made a mistake I have not wasted as much money.

Test Plans.
-----------

I have drafted a series of quick test plans for all three PCB's involved in this project. This should allow me to patially build each prototype and test the riskiest subsystems before completed the entire board. If a problem is encountered it should be quicker to fix it, or in the event that the board is scrapped I will have lost fewer components.

-----------
Outstanding Issues:
* Note 3: Investigate diffuser options.
* Note 4: Draft list of leds for project.
