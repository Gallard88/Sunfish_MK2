### 1. Feb, 2016: Enclosure Depth
This was an investigation into how deep a Hammond ABS enclosure can 
be submerged until it begins to leak.

Results
-----------
All but one tested enclosure began to leak. These enclosures are 
unsuitable for protecting submerged electronics. As a result 
alternative designs must be considered.
