* Minimum 1 hour run time.

Environment
-----------
* Able to dive to a depth of at least 5 meters.
* Tetherd to a surface control system.
* Dimensions of less than 40cm W x 40cm L x 25 cm H.

Tether 
=======

The tether will consist of an Ethernet cable & 2 conductors carrying power.

Ethernet:
-----------
* Cable type: CAT5 or 6.
* Length: 30m.

Power Cables
-----------
* Cable Type: 8 - 12 AWG, preferably 10.
