Concept Notes 1.

Januray 2016

This is the first of many concept notes about the design of the new Sunfish ROSV. These notes aim to capture the design process and various lines of thinking under taken during the development.

Electronics layout
-----------

The system's electronics could be enclosed in Hammond Containers. This would consist:
1 box for batteries.
1 box to house the camera & SBC. 
1-2 boxes to house power electronics (e.g. lighting & thruster control).
Many small boxes to house USB powered sensors.

For this design to work the depth rating of the Hammond Enclosures needs to be determined. Since these are only IP-67 they may not work at all. 

See Investigation_Notes/BoxDepth for more details.
