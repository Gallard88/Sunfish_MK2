This is a project that aims to desing and construct an robotic submarine. The project consists of a submersible vehicle and a
surface based control system. The control software will run on Linux and when required will use the ROS framework.

This repo contains the design decisions and data related to the next variant of my remotely operated submersible vehicle.
These folders contains:
* Research into various ideas and techniques for the construction of the system. 
* Research into available hardware and designs. 
* Calculations related to the design of the system.
