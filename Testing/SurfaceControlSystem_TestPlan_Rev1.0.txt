Surface Control System Test Plan
Date: 16/05/2016
Rev 1.0

Tests to perform:

1. Charger Voltage
Charger should output a voltage of 14V.

2. Charger Overload
Check that when overloaded the charger IC current limits to ~1A

3. Battery charge current
Verify battery trickle charges correctly. Battery should float to 13-14V

4. 5V regulator Voltage 
Circuit should regulate around 5V.

5. 5V regulator Current 
Circuit should source 4-5A and should enter constant current mode when there is a fault.

6. Battery Over voltage
Ensure idea diode circuit works corretly.

7. High Current Outputs
Ensure each output can source 15A continuosly.

7. Low Current Outputs
Ensure each output can source 5A continuosly.
