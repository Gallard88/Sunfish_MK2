ECU Test Plan
Date: 16/05/2016
Rev 1.0

Tests to perform:

1. Reverse voltage.
Check that the TVS diode clamps a reverse voltage at 0.7V.

2. 5V regulator Voltage 
Circuit should regulate around 5V.

3. 5V regulator Current 
Circuit should source 4-5A and should enter constant current mode when there is a fault.

4. 3V3 regulator Voltage 
Circuit should regulate around 3V3.

5. Current Sense Amp. 
Reference Voltage should be at 0V.

6. Motor Driver - Running
Check PWM outputs work.

7. Motor Driver - Fault
Check PWM outputs fault when shorted.

8. CPU - Programming
Ensure CPU can be programmed via OpenOCD.

9. CPU - USB
Ensure CPU connects via USB as a HID device.

10. INS Coms
Ensure INS can be communicated with.

11. Dataflash Coms
Ensure Dataflash can be communicated with.

12. ADC Coms
Ensure ADC can be communicated with.

13. USART Coms
Ensure USART comms work correctly.
