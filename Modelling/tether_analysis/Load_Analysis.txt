MK1 Load Analysis.
=======
This test was conducted with a 12V 7.2AHr SLA, 8x bilge pumps (1100 GPH), a 20mOhm current sense resistor & an oscilloscope.


Results
=======
Vbatt = 13.1V.

Both pumps had a start up  transient of approximately 30ms.
The DC resistance was calculated by dividing the voltage by the peak current. A multimeter revealed that the DC impedance could vary significantly.


Static Load
-----------
I Average: 0.5A (10.1mV)

All Motors Starting at once
-----------
I peak: 23.2A (464mV)
I Average: 1.8A (36mV)

100mS Between Motors
-----------
I peak: 18A (360mV)
I Average: 1.8A (36mV)

Conclusion
=======
Staggering the motors turning on by 100 ms reduced the peak current by 5A.
In a real environment it would be rare to have all motors enable at once.
