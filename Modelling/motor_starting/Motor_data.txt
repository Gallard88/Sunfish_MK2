Motor Power Analysis.
=======
This test was conduted with a 12V 7.2AHr SLA, 2x bilge pumps (300 GPH & 1100 GPH), a 20mOhm current sense resistor & an oscilloscope.


Results
=======
Vbatt = 12.9V.
Both pumps had a start up  transient of approximately 30ms.
The DC resistance was calculated by dividing the voltage by the peak current. A multimeter revealed that the DC impedance could vary significantly.


300 GPH
-----------
I peak: 8.1A (162mV)
I Average: 0.86A (17.2mV)
DC Resistance: 1.6 Ohm


1100 GPH
-----------
I peak: 5.52A (276mV)
I Average: 1.1A (22mV)
DC Resistance: 2.3 Ohm

Conclusion
=======
The smaller pump has a higher peak but a lower average current. 
A pump takes approximately 30ms to reach full speed (based on current profile).
A first order approximation of a pump starting can be found in this directory (Motor_startng_model.asc)
